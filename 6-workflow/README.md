## 🌟 Overview

**LangGraph** is a powerful framework for building stateful, multi-step AI workflows using Large Language Models (LLMs). This collection demonstrates four essential patterns:

- **Prompt Chaining**: Sequential story enhancement with conditional logic
- **Parallelization**: Concurrent execution for faster story generation
- **Routing**: Intelligent decision-making for educational content
- **Orchestrator-Worker**: Hierarchical task delegation for complex content creation

Each pattern solves different challenges in AI application development, from simple linear workflows to complex multi-agent systems.

## 🔄 Workflow Patterns

### 1. 📝 Prompt Chaining (Sequential Processing)
**Complexity**: Simple → Medium  
**Pattern**: Linear workflow with conditional loops

Sequential execution where each step depends on the previous one, with built-in quality control and retry logic.

### 2. ⚡ Parallelization (Concurrent Processing)
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Pattern**: Parallel execution with synchronization

Multiple independent tasks run simultaneously, then combine results for optimal performance.

### 3. 🎯 Routing (Decision-Based Processing)
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Pattern**: Conditional branching with intelligent routing

Dynamic decision-making that routes requests to appropriate specialized handlers based on content analysis.

### 4. 🏗️ Orchestrator-Worker (Hierarchical Processing)
**Complexity**: Complex  
**Pattern**: Multi-level delegation with coordination

Master-worker architecture where an orchestrator plans and delegates tasks to specialized workers.

## 📖 Detailed Workflows

### 1. 📝 Prompt Chaining Workflow

#### 🎯 Purpose
Creates and progressively enhances a story through multiple sequential steps with quality validation.

#### 🔧 How It Works
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Generate Story]
    B --> C[Check Conflict]
    C -->|Fail| B
    C -->|Pass| D[Improve Story]
    D --> E[Polish Story]
    E --> F[End]
```
## ✨ Features

- **Conditional Retry Logic**: Regenerates content if quality checks fail  
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each step builds upon the previous  
- **State Management**: Tracks story evolution through all stages  
- **Quality Validation**: Ensures output meets specific criteria  

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Content refinement workflows  
- Quality-controlled generation  
- Multi-step creative processes  
- Iterative improvement tasks

## 📊 Example Flow

<!-- Add your diagram or code snippet here -->
## 🧠 Example: Agentic AI Story Flow

**Input:**  
`"Agentic AI Systems"`

**↓ Generate →**  
*“An autonomous AI agent seeks purpose beyond its programming.”*

**↓ Improve →**  
*“In a distant future, an autonomous AI agent, designed to optimize city logistics, begins to question the nature of its coded directives and yearns for meaning.”*

**↓ Polish →**  
*“…until it rewrites its own source code to become the city's mysterious underground artist.”*
## 2. ⚡ Parallelization Workflow
