## 🏢 Project Lead: CEO Agent Agentic AI System

Welcome to the **CEO Agentic AI Project**, a cutting-edge implementation of multi-agent orchestration using LangChain and LangGraph. This system emulates an organizational hierarchy where an autonomous CEO coordinates research and report generation through a team of specialized agents—transforming queries into actionable executive intelligence.

---

## 📘 Introduction

The **CEO Agentic AI Project** is a multi-agent workflow designed to handle complex business or technical queries with minimal human intervention. Powered by tools like **ArXiv**, **Wikipedia**, and **Tavily search**, this project uses **LLMs** and **LangGraph** to create a pipeline that automates:

- Query analysis  
- Research delegation  
- Report writing (technical + executive summary)

The entire system mimics a real-world corporate structure, enabling **parallel task processing** and **centralized decision-making**.

---

## ⚙️ Workflow Overview

The project uses **LangGraph** to manage agent interactions, with the following agents:

### 👔 CEO Agent
- Central decision-maker  
- Delegates to research or writing teams based on state  
- Determines when the task is complete  

### 📊 Research Team Leader
- Analyzes the query  
- Routes to:
  - 🔬 **Data Researcher Agent** – academic, technical research (ArXiv, Wikipedia)
  - 💹 **Market Researcher Agent** – market trends, financial data (Tavily, Wikipedia)
- Compiles findings into structured research  

### ✍️ Writing Team Leader
- Manages:
  - 📝 **Technical Writer Agent** – writes the technical section
  - 📝 **Summary Writer Agent** – writes the executive summary  
- Assembles a comprehensive final report  

### 🔄 Router
- Determines the next agent based on current state
