Beausoleil\\nSummary: Silicon photonics has evolved from lab research to commercial products in the\\npast decade as it plays an increasingly crucial role in data communication for\\nnext-generation data centers and high performance computing1. Recently,\\nprogrammable silicon photonics has also found new applications in quantum2 and\\nclassical 3 information processing. A key component of programmable silicon\\nphotonic integrated circuits (PICs) is the phase shifter, traditionally\\nrealized via the thermo-optic or plasma dispersion effect which are weak,\\nvolatile, and power hungry. A non-volatile phase shifter can circumvent these\\nlimitations by requiring zero power to maintain the switched phases. Previously\\nnon-volatile phase modulation was achieved via phase-change4 or ferroelectric\\nmaterials5, but the switching energy remains high (pico to nano joules) and the\\nspeed is slow (micro to milli seconds). Here, we report a non-volatile\\nIII-V-on-silicon photonic phase shifter based on HfO2 memristor with sub-pJ\\nswitching energy (~400fJ), representing over an order of magnitude improvement\\nin energy efficiency compared to the state of the art. The non-volatile phase\\nshifter can be switched reversibly using a single 100ns pulse and exhibits an\\nexcellent endurance over 800 cycles. This technology can enable future\\nenergy-efficient programmable PICs for data centers, optical neural networks,\\nand quantum information processing.\\n\\nPublished: 2011-04-21\\nTitle: Graphene quantum dots for valley-based quantum computing: A feasibility study\\nAuthors: G. Y. Wu, N. -Y. Lue, L. Chang\\nSummary: At the center of quantum computing1 realization is the physical\\nimplementation of qubits - two-state quantum information units. The rise of\\ngraphene2 has opened a new door to the implementation. Because graphene\\nelectrons simulate two-dimensional relativistic particles with two degenerate\\nand independent energy valleys,3 a novel degree of freedom (d.o.f.), namely,\\nthe valley state of an electron, emerges as a new information carrier.4 Here,\\nwe expand the Loss-DiVincenzo quantum dot (QD) approach in electron spin\\nqubits,5,6 and investigate the feasibility of double QD (DQD) structures in\\ngapful graphene as \"valley qubits\", with the logic 0 / 1 states represented by\\nthe \"valley\" singlet / triplet pair. This generalization is characterized by 1)\\nvalley relaxation time ~ O(ms), and 2) electric qubit manipulation on the time\\nscale ~ ns, based on the 1st-order \"relativistic effect\" unique in graphene. A\\npotential for valley-based quantum computing is present.\\n\\nPublished: 2020-02-22\\nTitle: Joint Transmission and Computing Scheduling for Status Update with Mobile Edge Computing\\nAuthors: Jie Gong, Qiaobin Kuang, Xiang Chen\\nSummary: Age of Information (AoI), defined as the time elapsed since the generation of\\nthe latest received update, is a promising performance metric to measure data\\nfreshness for real-time status monitoring. In many applications, status\\ninformation needs to be extracted through computing, which can be processed at\\nan edge server enabled by mobile edge computing (MEC). In this paper, we aim to\\nminimize the average AoI within a given deadline by jointly scheduling the\\ntransmissions and computations of a series of update packets with deterministic\\ntransmission and computing times. The main analytical results are summarized as\\nfollows. Firstly, the minimum deadline to guarantee the successful transmission\\nand computing of all packets is given. Secondly, a \\\\emph{no-wait computing}\\npolicy which intuitively attains the minimum AoI is introduced, and the\\nfeasibility condition of the policy is derived. Finally, a closed-form optimal\\nscheduling policy is obtained on the condition that the deadline exceeds a\\ncertain threshold. '"

       "'Page: Timeline of quantum computing and communication\\nSummary: This is a timeline of quantum computing and communication.\\n\\nPage: Institute for Quantum Computing\\nSummary: The Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) is an affiliate scientific research institute of the University of Waterloo located in Waterloo, Ontario with a multidisciplinary approach to the field of quantum information processing. IQC was founded in 2002 primarily through a donation made by Mike Lazaridis and his wife Ophelia whose substantial donations have continued over the years.  The institute is now located in the Mike & Ophelia Lazaridis Quantum-Nano Centre and the Research Advancement Centre at the University of Waterloo.\\nIts executive director is physics professor Norbert Lütkenhaus and hosts researchers based in 7 departments across 3 faculties at the University of Waterloo. In addition to theoretical and experimental research on quantum computing, IQC also hosts academic conferences and workshops, short courses for undergraduate and high school students, and scientific outreach events including open houses and tours for the public.\\n\\nPage: Quantum computing\\nSummary: A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. On small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing takes advantage of this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern \"classical\" computer. Theoretically a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is largely experimental and impractical, with several obstacles to useful applications.\\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in classical computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two \"basis\" states, a state that is in an abstract sense \"between\" the two basis states. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and quickly.\\nQuantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing  scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields).\\nIn principle, a classical computer can solve the same computational problems as a quantum computer, given enough time. Quantum advantage comes in the form of time complexity rather than computability, and quantum complexity theory shows that some quantum algorithms are exponentially more efficient than the best-known classical algorithms. A large-scale quantum computer could in theory solve computational problems that are not solvable within a reasonable timeframe for a classical computer. This concept of additional ability has been called \"quantum supremacy\". While such claims have drawn significant attention to the discipline, near-term practical use cases remain limited.'"

      "Summary: Research in software engineering is essential for improving development\n",

      "complex computations where quantum computers can greatly speed up the\n",

      "engineering. We also examine various QSE techniques that expedite software\n",
      "development. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in\n",

      "machine learning (QML) and quantum optimization have substantial potential to\n",
      "address classical software engineering tasks, though this area is still\n",
      "limited. Current QSE tools and techniques lack robustness and maturity,\n",
